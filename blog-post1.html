        <h1>Why Don’t Fish Have Eyebrows?</h1>
        <p>Ever wondered why fish don’t have eyebrows? It’s one of those peculiar questions that might make you scratch your head. Well, let’s dive into the deep waters of this question and explore some interesting facts and theories!</p>
        
        <h2>The Biology of Fish</h2>
        <p>Fish have evolved to live underwater, where their primary sensory inputs come from their sense of smell and lateral line system rather than sight alone. Eyebrows, which are primarily used for facial expressions and to keep sweat out of the eyes, aren’t necessary in the aquatic environment where fish live.</p>

        <h2>Evolutionary Perspective</h2>
        <p>From an evolutionary standpoint, fish have adapted to their environments in ways that do not require the need for eyebrows. Their body structures are optimized for survival in water, and their sensory systems are quite different from those of land animals.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>While it may seem amusing to think about fish with eyebrows, their unique adaptations and environments mean that they don’t need them. Their evolutionary path has provided them with different means of survival and interaction with their world.</p>
